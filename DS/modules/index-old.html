                <h4>SERIOUS INFECTIONS</h4>
                <p class="bold">Patients treated with oral Janus kinase inhibitors for inflammatory
                  conditions
                  are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death.
                  Reported infections include:</p>

                <ul class="info-list">
                  <li>Patients treated with oral Janus kinase inhibitors for inflammatory conditions are
                    at
                    risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death.
                    Reported infections include:</li>
                  <li>Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocystosis.</li>
                  <li>Bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster, and other infections due to opportunistic
                    pathogens.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="bold">Avoid use of OPZELURA in patients with an active, serious infection,
                  including
                  localized infections. If a serious infection develops, interrupt OPZELURA until the
                  infection is controlled. Carefully consider the benefits and risks of treatment prior to
                  initiating OPZELURA in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Closely monitor
                  patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after
                  treatment
                  with OPZELURA.
                </p>

                <p>Serious lower respiratory tract infections were reported in the clinical development
                  program
                  with topical ruxolitinib.</p>

                <p>
                  No cases of active tuberculosis (TB) were reported in clinical trials with OPZELURA.
                  Cases
                  of active TB were reported in clinical trials of oral Janus kinase inhibitors used to
                  treat
                  inflammatory conditions. Consider evaluating patients for latent and active TB infection
                  prior to administration of OPZELURA. During OPZELURA use, monitor patients for the
                  development of signs and symptoms of TB. </p>

                <p>
                  Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster),
                  were
                  reported in clinical trials with Janus kinase inhibitors used to treat inflammatory
                  conditions including OPZELURA. If a patient develops herpes zoster, consider
                  interrupting
                  OPZELURA treatment until the episode resolves.
                  Hepatitis B viral load (HBV-DNA titer) increases, with or without associated elevations
                  in
                  alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, have been reported in patients
                  with
                  chronic HBV infections taking oral ruxolitinib. OPZELURA initiation is not recommended
                  in
                  patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.</p>

                <h4>MORTALITY </h4>

                <p><strong>In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
                    patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor
                    comparing an oral JAK inhibitor to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker treatment, a
                    higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was
                    observed
                    with the JAK inhibitor.</strong> Consider the benefits and risks for the individual
                  patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OPZELURA.
                </p>

                <h4>MALIGNANCIES</h4>

                <p> <strong>Malignancies were reported in patients treated with OPZELURA. Lymphoma and other
                    malignancies have been observed in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat
                    inflammatory conditions. In RA patients treated with an oral JAK inhibitor, a higher
                    rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) was observed when
                    compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at
                    additional
                    increased risk.</strong> </p>
                <p> Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or
                  continuing
                  therapy with OPZELURA, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than
                  successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancers), patients who develop a malignancy when
                  on
                  treatment, and patients who are current or past smokers. </p>
                <p> Non-melanoma skin cancers, including basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma, have
                  occurred
                  in patients treated with OPZELURA. Perform periodic skin examinations during OPZELURA
                  treatment and following treatment as appropriate. Exposure to sunlight and UV light
                  should
                  be limited by wearing protective clothing and using broad-spectrum sunscreen. </p>

                <h4>MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS (MACE)</h4>

                <p><strong>>In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk
                    factor treated with an oral JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of major adverse
                    cardiovascular
                    events (MACE) (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke),
                    was
                    observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers
                    are
                    at additional increased risk. Discontinue OPZELURA in patients who have experienced
                    a
                    myocardial infarction or stroke.</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or
                  continuing
                  therapy with OPZELURA, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and
                  patients
                  with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be informed about the symptoms
                  of
                  serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. Discontinue OPZELURA
                  in
                  patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke.</p>

                <h4>THROMBOSIS</h4>

                <p><strong>Thromboembolic events were observed in trials with OPZELURA. Thrombosis,
                    including
                    pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and arterial thrombosis have
                    been
                    reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions.
                    Many of these adverse reactions were serious and some resulted in death. In RA
                    patients
                    50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with
                    an
                    oral JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of thrombosis was observed when compared with TNF
                    blockers. Avoid OPZELURA in patients at risk. If symptoms of thrombosis occur,
                    discontinue OPZELURA and treat appropriately.</strong>

                <p class="bold"> Thrombocytopenia, Anemia, and Neutropenia</p>

                <p> Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia were reported in the clinical trials with
                  OPZELURA. Consider the benefits and risks for individual patients who have a known
                  history
                  of these events prior to initiating therapy with OPZELURA. Perform CBC monitoring as
                  clinically indicated. If signs and/or symptoms of clinically significant
                  thrombocytopenia,
                  anemia, and neutropenia occur, patients should discontinue OPZELURA. </p>

                <p class="bold">Adverse Reactions</p>

                <p> In atopic dermatitis, the most common adverse reactions (≥1%) are nasopharyngitis (3%),
                  diarrhea (1%), bronchitis (1%), ear infection (1%), eosinophil count increased (1%),
                  urticaria (1%), folliculitis (1%), tonsillitis (1%), and rhinorrhea (1%).
                  In nonsegmental vitiligo, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥1%) are
                  application
                  site acne (6%), application site pruritus (5%), nasopharyngitis (4%), headache (4%),
                  urinary
                  tract infection (2%), application site erythema (2%), and pyrexia (1%).</p>

                <p class="bold">Pregnancy</p>
                <p> There is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in pregnant persons
                  exposed
                  to OPZELURA during pregnancy. Pregnant persons exposed to OPZELURA and healthcare
                  providers
                  should report OPZELURA exposure by calling 1-855-463-3463.</p>

                <p class="bold">Lactation</p>
                <p> Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with OPZELURA and for approximately four
                  weeks after the last dose (approximately 5-6 elimination half-lives).</p>

                <h4>SERIOUS INFECTIONS</h4>
                <p class="bold">Patients treated with oral Janus kinase inhibitors for inflammatory
                  conditions
                  are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death.
                  Reported infections include:</p>

                <ul class="info-list">
                  <li>Patients treated with oral Janus kinase inhibitors for inflammatory conditions are
                    at
                    risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death.
                    Reported infections include:</li>
                  <li>Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocystosis.</li>
                  <li>Bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster, and other infections due to opportunistic
                    pathogens.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="bold">Avoid use of OPZELURA in patients with an active, serious infection,
                  including
                  localized infections. If a serious infection develops, interrupt OPZELURA until the
                  infection is controlled. Carefully consider the benefits and risks of treatment prior to
                  initiating OPZELURA in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Closely monitor
                  patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after
                  treatment
                  with OPZELURA.
                </p>

                <p>Serious lower respiratory tract infections were reported in the clinical development
                  program
                  with topical ruxolitinib.</p>

                <p>
                  No cases of active tuberculosis (TB) were reported in clinical trials with OPZELURA.
                  Cases
                  of active TB were reported in clinical trials of oral Janus kinase inhibitors used to
                  treat
                  inflammatory conditions. Consider evaluating patients for latent and active TB infection
                  prior to administration of OPZELURA. During OPZELURA use, monitor patients for the
                  development of signs and symptoms of TB. </p>

                <p>
                  Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster),
                  were
                  reported in clinical trials with Janus kinase inhibitors used to treat inflammatory
                  conditions including OPZELURA. If a patient develops herpes zoster, consider
                  interrupting
                  OPZELURA treatment until the episode resolves.
                  Hepatitis B viral load (HBV-DNA titer) increases, with or without associated elevations
                  in
                  alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, have been reported in patients
                  with
                  chronic HBV infections taking oral ruxolitinib. OPZELURA initiation is not recommended
                  in
                  patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.</p>

                <h4>MORTALITY </h4>

                <p><strong>In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
                    patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor
                    comparing an oral JAK inhibitor to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker treatment, a
                    higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was
                    observed
                    with the JAK inhibitor.</strong> Consider the benefits and risks for the individual
                  patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OPZELURA.
                </p>

                <h4>MALIGNANCIES</h4>

                <p> <strong>Malignancies were reported in patients treated with OPZELURA. Lymphoma and other
                    malignancies have been observed in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat
                    inflammatory conditions. In RA patients treated with an oral JAK inhibitor, a higher
                    rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) was observed when
                    compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at
                    additional
                    increased risk.</strong> </p>
                <p> Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or
                  continuing
                  therapy with OPZELURA, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than
                  successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancers), patients who develop a malignancy when
                  on
                  treatment, and patients who are current or past smokers. </p>
                <p> Non-melanoma skin cancers, including basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma, have
                  occurred
                  in patients treated with OPZELURA. Perform periodic skin examinations during OPZELURA
                  treatment and following treatment as appropriate. Exposure to sunlight and UV light
                  should
                  be limited by wearing protective clothing and using broad-spectrum sunscreen. </p>

                <h4>MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS (MACE)</h4>

                <p><strong>>In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk
                    factor treated with an oral JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of major adverse
                    cardiovascular
                    events (MACE) (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke),
                    was
                    observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers
                    are
                    at additional increased risk. Discontinue OPZELURA in patients who have experienced
                    a
                    myocardial infarction or stroke.</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or
                  continuing
                  therapy with OPZELURA, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and
                  patients
                  with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be informed about the symptoms
                  of
                  serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. Discontinue OPZELURA
                  in
                  patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke.</p>

                <h4>THROMBOSIS</h4>

                <p><strong>Thromboembolic events were observed in trials with OPZELURA. Thrombosis,
                    including
                    pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and arterial thrombosis have
                    been
                    reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions.
                    Many of these adverse reactions were serious and some resulted in death. In RA
                    patients
                    50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with
                    an
                    oral JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of thrombosis was observed when compared with TNF
                    blockers. Avoid OPZELURA in patients at risk. If symptoms of thrombosis occur,
                    discontinue OPZELURA and treat appropriately.</strong>

                <p class="bold"> Thrombocytopenia, Anemia, and Neutropenia</p>

                <p> Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia were reported in the clinical trials with
                  OPZELURA. Consider the benefits and risks for individual patients who have a known
                  history
                  of these events prior to initiating therapy with OPZELURA. Perform CBC monitoring as
                  clinically indicated. If signs and/or symptoms of clinically significant
                  thrombocytopenia,
                  anemia, and neutropenia occur, patients should discontinue OPZELURA. </p>

                <p class="bold">Adverse Reactions</p>

                <p> In atopic dermatitis, the most common adverse reactions (≥1%) are nasopharyngitis (3%),
                  diarrhea (1%), bronchitis (1%), ear infection (1%), eosinophil count increased (1%),
                  urticaria (1%), folliculitis (1%), tonsillitis (1%), and rhinorrhea (1%).
                  In nonsegmental vitiligo, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥1%) are
                  application
                  site acne (6%), application site pruritus (5%), nasopharyngitis (4%), headache (4%),
                  urinary
                  tract infection (2%), application site erythema (2%), and pyrexia (1%).</p>

                <p class="bold">Pregnancy</p>
                <p> There is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in pregnant persons
                  exposed
                  to OPZELURA during pregnancy. Pregnant persons exposed to OPZELURA and healthcare
                  providers
                  should report OPZELURA exposure by calling 1-855-463-3463.</p>

                <p class="bold">Lactation</p>
                <p> Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with OPZELURA and for approximately four
                  weeks after the last dose (approximately 5-6 elimination half-lives).</p>
